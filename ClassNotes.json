(this is gna be the longest note ur gonna be reading but…NONE OF THESE ARE CHATGPT OKAY >:0)\n\n Yk, people ask us why we are doing an ENTIRE WEBSITE of well wishes for u even though ur gonna be back in a semester. I too question myself. But as I look back at the times we’ve spent grinding our asses off, I think that u really do deserve more than what I can give. Yk after u come back, people are gonna start their internships, their acad / FYP, and people are gonna start going their separate ways. And then I realise, dayum, my MVP aint gonna be here with me to end the 2nd year in a blast…\n\n The morning texts of “SHIT I WOKE UP LATE, HELP ME TELL CHER”; the “Help me vet, if I don’t get 4.0 its on u”; the “⁠general NOW”; the spicy lunch topics that stayed at the same food central table during our 2 hr breaks; the “lets go for this event, it seems interesting!!”; the “4.0 BY THE WAY” also HAHAHA; and lets not forget, the 12 hours of grinding in Idea Space 1, 5 days a week. The blood sweat tears and joyful moments, good’ol days aint it… if only we cld relive the semester!! (obvs NOT MAKANMATCH WAS HELL…)\n\n Yeah but, couldn’t have reached where I am today without u!!! U’ve done SO MUCH for me, this is the least I can do… Im sure u will have fun in Korea, yk study there, meet new people, enjoy the opposite of the weather in Singapore, be the only odd one out (iykyk HAHAHA), but that being said, highs don’t come without lows. Yeah it aint gonna be easy, especially when all u eat is trees (sorry kinda funny HAHHAHA) and staying in an unfamiliar environment for a few months. But mate, I know u’d pull through! Well even if u don’t, ur brodahs got ur back, we r js one “#CITY HALL NOW” away <3\n\n Wishing u all the best in Korea! Drinks on me when ur back brodahhh!!\n\n Heres a little poem just for u:\n Through late mornings and grinds we've shared,\n Laughter and tears, we were always prepared.\n From spicy chats to endless nights,\n In every struggle, we found our heights.\n As you journey far to lands anew,\n Remember, your brodah’s here for you.\n Though trees might be your daily fare,\n You’ll thrive and grow, just anywhere.\n So here's to you, as you take this flight,\n We'll hold it down, till you reunite.\n In every text, in every cheer,\n Know that we’re just a call from near.\n Wishing you the best, no matter where,\n And when you’re back, drinks in the air!\n\n Signing off, ur one and only",

Whether it was as our class rep or group leader, you really brought so much energy and fun to our time together.\n\n I'm really sad I won't be able to join in the final farewell before you head to Korea, but I promise I'll be there to welcome you back like a champion returning from the Olympics! ✨\n\n Have a safe flight, make tons of new friends over there, and most importantly, stay safe!
